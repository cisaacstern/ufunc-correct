blockquote = """The name <code>ufunc-correct</code> 
refers to the specific implementation of the terrain correction 
algorithm. In the NumPy lexicon, a <code>ufunc</code> or so-called 
"universal function" leverages linear algebraic efficiencies. This can be 
counter-intuitive for timeseries analyses, because it plays with our
sense of temporality. Further philospohy and how-to on this subject
